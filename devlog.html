	<h1>DEV LOG</h1>
	<h2>Jan 05</h2>
	<p>I'm meditating on the best way to store the parsed data on a structure that C can understand.</p>

	<p>The challenges I'm facing is how to handle all the different sizes of objects in JSON. I would like to use an array like structure where I can have a multi-dimensional matrix where each dimension correlated to levels of nesting, but seems like every cell of the matrix needs to be of variable size.</p>

	<p>For example JSON lists allow for different datatype.</p>

	<p>This is a valid list in JSON <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259"> RFC8259 </a></p>
	<p>"There is no requirement that the values in an array be of the same type.</p>

	<p>["string", 42, true, false, null,{"nested_key": "nested_value"},["array_element_1", "array_element_2"]]</p>
	
	<p>It seems that Linked Lists could solve this problem, reference to objects of any size sounds like exactly what I need.
	And seems that C arrays will be exactly something I wont be able to use, I cannot overcome the limitation of array elements needing to be the same size, nor I can workaround it by using an array of arbitrary size.</p>
	<h2>Jan 06</h2>
	<p>
	Today I started learning about Linked lists, the concept feels really useful and I'm confident I will be able to use them here. The problem I'm seeing is that I would not be exactly sure on how I will handle 1:x linkages. Because so far it seems I can only link elements in a 1:1 ratio. Head-> Tail.</p>

	<p>But in JSON there can be elements that link to two or more elements at the time. </p>

	<p>I'm reading about it, and it seems conceptually what I need would be a "Tree" structure, and it makes sense since I need branches that share a common node, but I do not need any other element of the branches to relate to other parallel branches.</p>

	<p>After reading more I see myself going into an immense rabbit hole. Because:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>1)I need a tree like structure to handle the "levels" or hierarchy of JSON objects.</li>
		<li>2)I need a linked list to handle  arrays with elements of different size in JSON.</li>
		<li>2.1) each element in the JSON array cannot only be different sizes but also have arbitrarily different sizes. For which I had a big problem. I cannot really go ahead an define each possibility with a struct. I need the size of each struct to be defined dynamically at runtime.</li>
		<li>2.1.1) for this I just discovered "void*" or the generic pointer, it seems exactly what I need so I can refer to nodes in the linked list were the next node is of an unknown size. </li>
	</ul>

		<p>Aside from this tree and linked list discussion (Which I have yet to make a proof of concept, this is all still on RAM)</p>

		<p>I have a preliminary idea of how I will handle the different values in JSON. These being strings,numbers,object,arrays,literals(true,false,null)</p>

		<p>I've settled with strings -> *char, numbers -> doubles(can also handle scientific notation), objects & arrays -> structs(tree, linked list) , literals -> Structs (of fixed size 10 bytes, 4 bytes for an "IsLiteral" int flag* and 6 bytes to store "true","false","null" character arrays) </p>

		<p>*This is so I can differentiate from the string value "true" from the literal "true" </p>

		<p>I believe tomorrow I'll work on making the proof of concept for: </p>

		<ol>
			<li><p>An n-ary tree structure that contains a linked list of pointers* to Heads of linked lists.</p>

				<p>* why a linked list for the tree branches? because I want to avoid having to define a set MAX_CHILD per tree node. A node might have three child's or may have just one.</p> </li>

			<li>A child linked list that will use void* to link up nodes of different sizes.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<p>I feel there is a shadow lurking of a problem I do not know yet how to approach, how will I exactly lookup key pairs within the linked list? I guess it will be iteratively, but I feel like every programmer ever like I'm thinking it will be "Easy" until I get to actually do it....
	<p>
	<h2>Jan 07</h2>
	<p>Today I created the first proof of concept in which I'm going to base the design of the project.</p>
	<p>The POC is about being able to create dynamically allocated linked lists, for fixed size nodes.</p>
	<p>I've practiced a few important concepts like, the use of pointers and utilization of malloc() and free()</p>
	
	<p>Next I will be exploring how to dynamically allocate linked lists for nodes of arbitrary sizes. Which should then use the void* pointer type"</p>
	<h2>Jan 08</h2>

	<p> Today I made progress on the proof of concept, I was able to build a linked list in which each node is a struct which can hold an arbitrarily big string as a key and an arbitrarily big block of memory for values.

	<p> I made the choice for values to be handled by a void pointer as I can make it point to any size block of memory, this way I believe it will allow me to point to other structs,linked lists, strings and doubles which should cover every possible JSON value.

	<p> The next step should be creating a poc for tree. </p>
	<h2>Jan 09</h2>
	<p>Working on the tree structure, now I'm able to create a linked list that refers to other linked lists.</p>
	<p>I'm honestly not sure if it qualifies as a tree, but I'll keep trying to make it work as is so I can hopefully apply the knowledge to the actual project.</p>

	<p> Currently I'm getting the errors </p> 

	<code>
		<p>poc_tree.c: In function ‘printObjects’:</p></p>
		<p>poc_tree.c:111:43: warning: dereferencing ‘void *’ pointer</p>
  		<p>111 |                         while ( head->step->next != NULL){</p>
      	<p>|                                           ^~</p>
		<p>poc_tree.c:111:43: error: request for member ‘next’ in something not a structure or union</p>
</code>

	The next step is working out if the code can be improved to avoid the warning without having to drop my use of void*
	<h2> Jan 11 </h2>

	<p> using void pointers is turning out not to be exactly the solution I'm looking for. This is because I think I'm using the void* wrongly, and to make up for it I have to do a lot of typecasting which defeats the purpose</p>

	<p> Thinking further I was able to restrict my model to two different main structs, which are very similar in size, and I'll handle them with an Union so it is more efficient in memory</p>

	<p> Further thinking on the actual values of the key value pair that I need to save, I was wrong thinking that I needed to handle the size of a whole JSON object or Array, I just need to handle the pointers to the head structure that I'll set up, so really all the references will be done to structures of known size.</p>

	<p> With regards to the values themselves, which are strings,doubles, literals (Not accounting objects and arrays, because those are handled with structs as mentioned above). I'm planning to also get them into an union</p>

	<p> I'm not quite sure yet, but I think my worries of having to set a max-size for strings are not well founded, since I will know exactly how big each string value will be at compile time and I can easily malloc() the exact size + 1 to account for '/0'.</p>

	<p> So it seems there is a way to get this all working without having to hardcode sizes nor using a void* and a lot of typecasting</p>
